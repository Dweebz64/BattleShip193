# Summary
Battleship 193 is a simple Python program that generates a graphical user interface (GUI) grid to play the classic game of Battleship. The game allows the user to make guesses by clicking on buttons representing the grid cells. The objective is to find and sink all five hidden enemy ships using as few moves as possible. The GUI is built using the Tkinter library.

# Quick Start Guide
Install Python: Before running the Battleship 193 program, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Download the Code: Download the Battleship 193 Python code and save it as a ".py" file on your computer.

Install Tkinter: Tkinter should come pre-installed with most Python distributions. However, if you encounter any issues related to Tkinter, you may need to install it separately. Tkinter is usually included in the standard library, so you don't need to download it separately in most cases.

Run the Program: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the Battleship 193 Python file, and execute the following command:  python battle.py

Gameplay: Once the GUI appears, you will see a grid of buttons representing the game board. Click on any button to make a guess. If you hit a hidden enemy ship, the button will display "O," indicating a hit. If your guess misses, the button will display "X." The game will keep track of your moves and hits.

Objective: Your goal is to sink all five enemy ships with as few moves as possible. Keep playing until you find all the hidden ships.

Restart the Game: To start a new game, click the "New Game" button, and the program will shuffle the ship positions, resetting the game board.
